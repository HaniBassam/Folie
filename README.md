Portfolio Website
This is a portfolio website built using React.js and Vite as the bundler. Vite helps in speeding up the development process with its fast hot module replacement and optimized build performance.

Project Structure
The project is organized into several key directories and files:

1. src/components/
   This folder contains all the React components used in the application:

About.jsx – The "About" section of the portfolio.
AboutMe.jsx – Another component providing more personal details.
Contact.jsx – A contact form where visitors can get in touch.
Footer.jsx – The footer section.
Nav.jsx – The navigation bar used to switch between sections.
Portfolio.jsx & Portfolio2.jsx – These components showcase work.
Random.jsx & RandomFacts.jsx – Displays random fun facts or information.
SkillSection.jsx – This section highlights skill sets.

2. src/css/
   This folder includes all the CSS files that style the components:

Each component has a corresponding CSS file for styling, such as About.css, Footer.css, Portfolio.css, etc.

3. Other Important Files:
   App.jsx – The main component that brings everything together.
   index.html – The entry point of the application.
   vite.config.js – Vite's configuration file.

How to Run
